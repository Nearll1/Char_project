# Char project
 
*This is my second project*

# Resume:

This is a Chatbot that uses LLM and a VTS model to stream!
It is in the early develpment stage so dont expect much

# How to install/run:

Run the command :
```
git clone https://github.com/Nearll1/Char_project.git
```
After downloading the repo, run the command :
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you can set your credentials and api in a .env file or
change the code from : 
```
os.getenv(...)
```
tou you credentials

***Important Note***

> **This is my second project and i only have nearly 2 month of coding experience, i also didnt use any AI help in the project SO it should not be good enought for a real live stream and may have bugs.**
